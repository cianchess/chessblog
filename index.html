			  <p>My earliest memory of playing chess is my grandfather teaching me how the pieces moved when I was around 7 years old. He never went easy on me and I would often fall victim to the 4 move checkmate or so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar%27s_mate" target="_blank">"scholar's mate"</a> before I wisened up and learned to defend myself against it. My father would also beat me with this tactic. I can't remember the first time I beat them but it took some years of maturing before I could play at their level.</p>
			  <p>I remember being gifted a quaint little magnetic chess set and I would bring it into school and challenge my classmates. I was quite above their level having practiced against my father and grandfather and took great delight in sadisticly eliminating all their pieces down to the last pawn systematically with my queen before putting them out of their misery, checkmating them with an almost full army.</p>
			  <p>I only ever played chess casually with family and friends up until the age of 16 when my father and I joined the Curragh Chess Club. Originally it was because of a TY project that I decided to take it up. We were assigned to take up a hobby and document our progress and I thought why not pursue my interest of chess. The club would convene every Thursday at around 7:30 until late as games could often last for hours. I recall the original venue being an old library I believe but the only thing that really stands out to me about the venue was how absolutely freezing it was, I would play games wrapped up in a thick coat, teeth chattering as I don't deal well with the cold to begin with, perhaps because of my Spanish genes. I would always get seasoned club member Dermot Earles to sign off on my attendance sheet every week to mark that I had attended. I love playing video games and thinking strategically so I think chess has always had a natural draw to me for me and it's why I ended up sticking with it despite my discouraging results in the beginning.</p>
			  <p>My first game was against another new member who's name I can't recall since I never saw him there again and I recall the game ending in a draw after what must have been a bizarre back and forth of two novices stumbling their way through murky complications. Whenever I played against a seasoned member however I would pretty much always lose as there is quite a significant gap between a novice and a seasoned club player. Chess can have quite a difficult learning curve and it can be quite demoralizing for a new player to get into the game since you usually lose in quite a brutal fashion until you learn basic strategical concepts and tactical patterns. I'm happy I stuck with it because although it took quite some time, maybe a year or so but I managed to improve quite drastically and it was very satisfying being able to get revenge and beat regular club members. It felt good being selected to play on a team in the <a href="https://leinsterchess.com/" target="_blank">Leinster Leagues</a> and I was motivated to continue playing and improving.</p>
			  <p>Fast forward to today in October of 2024, <span class="bold italic">I have joined the Bray/Greystones chess club</span> after a hiatus of about 4 years or so of not playing. I was immidiately signed up for their internal rated event as someone had dropped out and they needed a replacement. It's a swiss style tournament consisting of about 26 players. I was a bit apprehenisve about playing rated games straight away after a long break but I decided to try not worry about losing rated points and just try to enjoy the games. I was surprised to learn I was actually the highest rated seed in the event. Apparently unbeknownst to me, the <a href="https://www.icu.ie/home" target="_blank">Irish Chess Union</a> had given everyone a boost to their <a href="https://ratings.icu.ie/" target="_blank">ICU rating</a> to address rating deflation and the generally lower value of Irish ratings compared to other rating systems. My rating had changed from about 1750 when I stopped to now 1902 which is quite the bump. At the time I'm writing this I've played three games and managed to win all three against pretty stiff opposition too. They weren't the best played games but I somehow managed to survive in some difficult positions and seized my chances when they came.</p>
			  <p>I've since started to compete in the <a href="https://leinsterchess.com/" target="_blank">Leinster Leagues</a> as well although my results have not been very good so far. I was declared for their division 5 team but this is so I can play a game or two for them to try and give them a boost hopefully with a victory or two but the main division I will be competing in is division 2. There is a rule that players cannot play below the division they are declared in but they can sub up but only for three games until they are considered part of the team they are subbing for.</p>

			  <p>This is a weekend tournament where  managed to finish in joint first place. I was playing in the minor section which is for players rated below 1200 elo so I was still quite an inexperienced player. Weekend tournaments consist of 6 classical time control games played across three days with each game easily lasting over 2-3 hours so it can be quite gruelling. Here I've posted analysis of all 6 games so you can experience the madness that can occur in lower rated games, the good bad and the ugly. <a href="#">about anything...</a></p>

			  <p>This is the same weekend tournament but this time I'm competing in the next rating category 1200-1600 elo. The quality of the games is definitely higher and I'm quite pleased with all the games except for the one I drew. Here I finished outright first place with a score of 5.5/6 so it was a much more convincing victory and I claimed the first place prize money all to myself. <a href="#">about anything...</a></p>
